"""Output the last part of files in a task's sandbox

Usage:
    dcos tail --info
    dcos tail [--follow --completed --lines=N] <task> [<file>]

Options:
    -h, --help    Show this screen
    --info        Show a short description of this subcommand
    --follow      Output data as the file grows
    --completed   Tail files from completed tasks as well
    --lines=N     Output the last N lines [default: 10]
    --version     Show version

Positional Arguments:

    <task>        Only match tasks whose ID matches <task>.  <task> may be
                  some substring of the ID, or a unix glob pattern.

    <file>        Output this file. [default: stdout]
